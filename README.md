Here is a convolutional neural network model(CNN model). The aim of this project was to identify certain vehicles (cars, vans and trucks) using an ai model.
In this project, i have used a YOLO-model and trained it using our own collected dataset. We went around the city of Copenhagen and took pictures of these vehicle types in a natural scenario (sunny day, rainy day, night time, day time, parked or in traffic etc.). We have also annotated these images with bounding boxes using Roboflow.

We have used image augmentations and regularisation techniques, so each image has more variety. This is beacuse our dataset is very small (344 images uploaded in roboflow). At the end we show the result of the model identifying different vehicles within images.
